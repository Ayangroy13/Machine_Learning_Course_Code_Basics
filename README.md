# Master Machine Learning for Data Science & AI: Beginner to Advanced

## Course Overview
As someone eager to dive deep into Machine Learning, I've found an incredible opportunity to learn from an AI entrepreneur with extensive industry experience. The course is structured to take you from beginner to advanced levels, offering deep intuition on algorithms while keeping the learning experience engaging with cinematic presentations. It’s not just theory—end-to-end projects and hands-on coding practice ensure you get a real feel for applying what you learn. Even better is that it’s designed to be easily understood, even by high school students. This journey into Machine Learning feels both accessible and exciting.

### Course Work
### Day 1: 
- There are two major use cases of machine learning: Classification and Regression.
- Classification is the process of dividing data into specific groups, such as 'red' or 'blue', 'male' or 'female'.
- Regression is about predicting a numerical value based on the previous values and their related features.
- Classification technique is often used in fraud detection, news category classification, etc.
- The regression technique is often used to predict stock prices, housing prices, salaries, etc.
- Email spam detection is enabled by a machine-learning model.
- A machine is trained by providing the input and output data, not the logic.
- The machine learns to infer the logic based on the input and output data provided.
- Machine learning methods are broadly classified into two types: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
- Supervised learning is a method in which the model is trained on a labeled dataset such as house price prediction.
- Unsupervised learning is a method in which the input data is not provided with labels and the model is expected to classify the data based on hidden patterns and structures like document classification.
