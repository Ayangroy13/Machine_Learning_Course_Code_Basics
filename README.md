# Master Machine Learning for Data Science & AI: Beginner to Advanced

## Course Overview
As someone eager to dive deep into Machine Learning, I've found an incredible opportunity to learn from an AI entrepreneur with extensive industry experience. The course is structured to take you from beginner to advanced levels, offering deep intuition on algorithms while keeping the learning experience engaging with cinematic presentations. It’s not just theory—end-to-end projects and hands-on coding practice ensure you get a real feel for applying what you learn. Even better is that it’s designed to be easily understood, even by high school students. This journey into Machine Learning feels both accessible and exciting.

### Course Work
### Day 1: 
- There are two major use cases of machine learning: Classification and Regression.
- Classification is the process of dividing data into specific groups, such as 'red' or 'blue', 'male' or 'female'.
- Regression is about predicting a numerical value based on the previous values and their related features.
- Classification technique is often used in fraud detection, news category classification, etc.
- The regression technique is often used to predict stock prices, housing prices, salaries, etc.
- A machine-learning model enables email spam detection.
- A machine is trained by providing the input and output data, not the logic.
- The machine learns to infer the logic based on the input and output data provided.
- Machine learning methods are broadly classified into Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
- Supervised learning is a method in which the model is trained on a labeled dataset such as house price prediction.
- Unsupervised learning is a method in which the input data is not provided with labels and the model is expected to classify the data based on hidden patterns and structures like document classification.

  ### Day 2:
- NumPy (numeric Python) is a popular library for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
- Any person doing data analysis or machine learning in Python, uses NumPy almost daily.
- Numpy arrays offer several benefits over plain Python lists such as,
- Less memory consumption Fast operations
- Convenient APIs for a variety of mathematical functions
- You do not have to remember API syntax. In real life, people always refer to NumPy documentation, ChatGPT or Google to know the syntax.
- sum(), min(), max(), std() are used for doing quick statistical analysis.
- ndim, item size, size, and shape are the functions used for figuring out an array's dimensions, element byte size, total number of elements, and the size of each dimension, respectively.

- Using NumPy, one can conveniently perform matrix operations.
- For two matrices (m1 and m2), one can do addition, subtraction, division and multiplication by using +,-/and operators.
- np.dot(m1,m2) and np.cross(m1, m2) can be used to perform a dot and cross products between two metrices (m1 and m2).
- NumPy supports index and slicing operators similar to Python native list.
- np.hstack and np.vstack are used to stack two NumPy arrays horizontally and vertically.
- np.hsplit and np.vsplit are used to split a numpy array either horizontally or vertically.
